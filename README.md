# Tutorial Angular 12 - Hero

Heroes tutorial shows you how to set up your local development environment and develop an application using the Angular CLI tool, and provides an introduction to the fundamentals of Angular.

The Tour of Heroes application that you build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The application has many of the features you'd expect to find in any data-driven application. The finished application acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

You will find references to and expansions of this application domain in many of the examples used throughout the Angular documentation, but you don't necessarily need to work through this tutorial to understand those examples.
